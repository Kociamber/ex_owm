# ExOwm

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Kociamber/ex_owm.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Kociamber/ex_owm)

**Fast, industrial strength [OpenWeatherMap](http://openweathermap.org/technology) interface for based Elixir platforms.**

## Installation

Add ExOwm as a dependency to your `mix.exs` file:

```elixir
defp deps() do
  [{:ex_owm, "~> 1.0"}]
end
```

Main functionalities are there, it's working but it's also under heavy WIP - please do not use it until official release :-)

It is using many cool features like:

*   concurrent API calls and response processing
*   generational caching
*   access to **all** [OWM APIs](http://openweathermap.org/api)!

Soon you will see here a well documented project and its use cases.
