**Blazingly fast and industrial strength [OpenWeatherMap](http://openweathermap.org/technology) interface for Elixir platforms.**
Main functionalities are there, it's working but it's also under heavy WIP - please do not use it until official release :-)

It is using many cool features like:

* concurrent API calls and response processing
* generational caching
* access to __all__ [OWM APIs](http://openweathermap.org/api)!

Soon you will see here a well documented project and its use cases.
